#  Basic Understanding of Nodejs.
## Key features that make Node.js suitable for modern web applications.
   - Single-Threaded: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop to handle all requests thus minimizes overhead and improves performance.
   - Scalability:The event loop allows Node.js to handle thousands of connections simultaneously with minimal resource consumption and combined with asynchronous I/O operations, 
     enables developers to build highly scalable applications.
   - Fast Performance: Been built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its high performance. V8 compiles JavaScript directly to machine code, making execution extremely fast.
   - Real-Time Applications: The speed of Node.js is particularly beneficial for real-time applications such as chat applications, gaming servers, and collaboration tools. 
     Its ability to handle a high volume of short-lived connections makes it ideal for these use cases.
   - Rich Ecosystem and NPM: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of modules and libraries available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). With over a million packages, 
    NPM provides solutions for almost every conceivable problem, significantly speeding up the development process.
   - Community Support: The consistent community contributes to a constantly growing collection of modules, ensuring that developers have access to the latest tools and best practices.
   - Cross-Platform Compatibility: Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
     This versatility allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere, reducing the complexity of deploying applications across different environments.
